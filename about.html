Hey!
  </h3>

  <p class="flex-item-1">

    My name is Jennifer, but my friends call me Jenn. The second N is totally unnecessary but I thought it was cool in high school and now I can't seem to drop it. I'm a Scottish transplant and my official background is in healthcare, but my true passion lies in creating content. I love to write, to problem solve, and to make things look pretty. I blog about shallow stuff like eye cream and I privately write about serious stuff like morality, and I find joy in all of it. I started out dabbling in self-hosted Wordpress and decided I wanted more control over my content. I discovered I loved the problem solving aspect of front end development, and now here I am. It's nice to meet you!</p>
